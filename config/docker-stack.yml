  ## defines a task to run the celery worker container in. these tasks are 
  ## replicated through the docker swarm nodes the 'cpus' key reflects how 
  ## much cputime each worker is allowed to consume on the host. remove for 
  ## auto-allocation, or dial in for more control per worker (same for memory).
  ##
  ## a worker service can be defined for each host (and resources customized 
  ## accordingly), if you create another worker service named something else
  ## (like 'worker-server2'), and then under placement.constraints, add the
  ## name of the label you gave that system (accomplished by doing something
  ## like 'docker node update --label-add name=server2 <node_name>'). see 
  ## https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_update/ for
  ## details.
