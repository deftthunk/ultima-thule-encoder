rotfl, I'm glad you're haviong fun. I mostly followeed all of that

I do like the idea of not reading in the config each time. Will this allow for per file configs?
like I want a config file to describe each job. Eventually you'd have some jobs with filters, some without, some with really good settings that are slow and some that are less so because it's a TV show and you don't care lol
going back through some of my movie files and finding bloated ones to convert

Alternately you could have several folders each with different configurations maybe?
