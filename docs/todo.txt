- COMPLETED|make async function to determine average fps being encoded on swarm
- figure out windows madness
- dynamically add/remove workers to/from swarm
- logging
- config
- watchdog (dynamically change timeout, restart failed workers, finish failed tasks)
- detect when a worker goes down, and requeue their work. otherwise the job hanges indefinitely
- coastdown/shutdown
- python TUI


BUGS:
- only one high task gets queued at a time
- if checkForWork() finds existing work, the generated array of work will be
	passed onto checkForErrors() in its truncated form, and UTE will only look at the first
	'x' amount of chunks
- if a worker is added while UTE is processing, it seems not all workers in teh swarm stay active?
- COMPLETED|: requeuing failed jobs sends them to back of queue
- COMPLETED|: starts encoding file while file still transfering to inbox
- sometimes requeue can be an infinite loops since same failed worker keeps getting same failed
task. try sleeping on worker or requeue for a few seconds to avoid?
