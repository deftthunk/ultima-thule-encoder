- fix: only one high task gets queued at a time
- fix: if checkForWork() finds existing work, the generated array of work will be
	passed onto checkForErrors() in its truncated form, and UTE will only look at the first
	'x' amount of chunks
- COMPLETED|fix: requeuing failed jobs sends them to back of queue
- COMPLETED|fix: starts encoding file while file still transfering to inbox
- python TUI
- watchdog (dynamically change timeout, restart failed workers, finish failed tasks)

- coastdown/shutdown
- notice when a worker goes down, and requeue their work. otherwise the job hanges indefinitely
- sometimes requeue can be an infinite loops since same failed worker keeps getting same failed
task. try sleeping on worker or requeue for a few seconds to avoid?


ansible stuff
- ansible: for redis host, set host system parameters to stop warnings:
  echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
  echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
  sudo sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1
