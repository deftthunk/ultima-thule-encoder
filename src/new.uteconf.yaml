## Task Settings
##
## a 'task' represents all the information and state regarding the processing of a file 
## in UTE. these settings affect aspects of a task's encoding, muxing, subtitles, etc
TASK:
  config_file_persist: False
  log_level: info
  job_size: 125
  frame_buffer_size: 100
  job_timeout: 600
  crop_sample_count: 17
  timeOffsetPercent: 0.15
  check_work_thread_count: 4
  find_work_thread_count_max: 16
  crop_detect: "24:16:0"


  # The arguments '-ss', '-hide_banner', and '-i', are reserved by 
  # UTE, and will be overwritten if present
  # 
  # UTE also adds '-filter:v "crop=<calulated value>"', as is calculated by the 
  # 'crop_config' section above. It can be overridden (along with all task settings) via
  # ".utconf.yml" config files co-located with the target video file
  #
  # Multiple lines are OK, but following lines must be indented past the 'ffmpeg' marker
  ffmpeg: ffmpeg -f yuv4mpegpipe -1 -loglevel fatal


  # UTE reserves the following arguments for use, and will overwrite these options if 
  # found:
  # '--frames', '--chunk-start', '--chunk-end', '--fps', and '-o'
  #
  # It is suggested to not use settings affecting how the encoder utilizes hardware 
  # resources, such as the '--pools' option in x265. If you want to affect how CPU 
  # resources are used, this is best done through granular settings in "docker-stack.yml".
  #
  # The resuling encoding string will be connected to FFMPEG via a pipe ('|') and work on
  # the data in a stream context
  #
  # Future releases may provide support for other encoders such as AV1
  #
  # Multiple lines are OK, but following lines must be indented past the 'encoder' marker
